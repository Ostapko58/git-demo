Now i deleted all lines and add songs text

When I met you in the summer
To my heartbeat's sound.
We fell in love,
As the leaves turned brown.

And we could be together, baby
As long as skies are blue
You act so innocent now
But you lied so soon

And we could be together, baby
As long as skies are blue
You act so innocent now
But you lied so soon
